# What should be put in each directory in src?

I am going to split header (seperate folders for header and source files) structure here, you can use any file structure

## configuration

This file is automatically generated.

## impl

.cc files / files that contain implementations for both public and private headers

## inc

.h files / private header files

## Convention I have followed for this project

Public headers are going to be in include/${PROJECT_NAME}/
Private headers are going to be in src/inc/
